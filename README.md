# Product Recommenders- Amazon üõçÔ∏è

---

## Overview
Recommender Systems play a pivotal role in suggesting products to users based on various factors. Inspired by industry leaders like Netflix and Amazon, these systems enhance user engagement by recommending items that align with their preferences and behavior.

## Project Scope
This project utilizes a dataset comprising 180K women's fashion products. The goal was to to build a robust recommender system using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The system will recommend similar products to customers, thereby enhancing their shopping experience.

The developed model generates personalized product recommendations based on user input or queries, utilizing sophisticated Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques such as Bag of Words (BoW), TF-IDF, and Word2Vec. It analyzes similarities between products to suggest items closely aligned with user preferences, enhancing the shopping experience.

## Approach
The project will implement three main approaches to develop text similarity-based recommender systems:
- Bag Of Words (BoW) model
- TF-IDF model
- Text Semantics model (Word2Vec)

## Final Output
Users can input a product query, and the system will display recommended products based on the developed models. This project aims to demonstrate the practical application of NLP in recommending relevant products on Amazon.
